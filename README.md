### Assumptions for Input Dataset

1. The input dataset is a table that is stored in .CSV file.
2. We use two real datasets: [COMPAS](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/blob/master/aif360/data/raw/compas/README.md), [MEPS](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/blob/master/aif360/data/raw/meps/README.md), and synthetic data that is generated by ourselves. Both real datasets are preprocessed as specified in [IBM AIF360](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360).

### Install CAIFRanking

Step 1 Download CAIFRanking.

Step 2 Unzip the downloaded source file and initiate the python environment.

```bash
cd CAIFRank  # go to the CAIFRank repository that is just downloaded
python -m venv CAIFRanking
source CAIFRanking/bin/activate  # activate the environment for CAIFRanking
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run CAIFRanking

All the experiments can be executed by bash script. For MacOS or Linux, run the following script under ROOT ACCESS.

For the experiments on synthetic data,
```bash
bash run_exp_syn.sh mv m2 data/mv_m2.json G
bash run_exp_syn.sh mvr m2 data/mvr_m2.json GR
bash run_exp_syn.sh mvp m2 data/mvp_m2.json G
```

For the experiments on real data,
```bash
bash run_exp_real_cm.sh
bash run_exp_real_mp.sh
bash run_exp_real_cs.sh
```
